# Smart_Fence
Intrusion Detection at border or at person property is one of the most important issue regarding asset and border disputes leading to crimes and violation of legal code of conduct. In this project we explore the power of state machines and Electronic Sensors to effectively detect various type of intrusions that are happening at the border or at any related personal property and raise an alarm.

# Designed a Secure Communication Module for real-time localization of high-speed vehicles like trains in railways.

 • Analyzed various Encryption Algorithms to conclude optimal one based on energy and time specifications.
 
 • Studied and implemented a two-way encrypted module for secure communication between train and passive RFID.
 
 • Verified all security aspects for this module to be used for the localization of trains in various Railway Systems.
